# threads_text_checker
A simple program designed to measure the length of a text and check if it complies with the character limits of a post on the Threads social network. Very useful for those who copy and paste texts on this network, or, like me, write directly from the computer.

--- Version 1.0 ---

The program works as follows: The user types or pastes the text they want to post to the Threads network into the program's text box, which will indicate in real time whether it falls within the network's character limit (500 characters). Additionally, the user can copy the content in the program's text box using a button, sending it to the device's clipboard.
